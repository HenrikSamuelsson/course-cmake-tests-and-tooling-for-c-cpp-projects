Notes on the course [CMake, Tests and Tooling for C/C++ Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/cmake-tests-and-tooling-for-cc-projects/).

## Tools on Windows

### Visual Studio Community 2022

Will use [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) edition for this course.

Important note is that when installing you manually need to choose the *Desktop development with C++* option found on the *Workloads* tab. This is to get a set of C/C++ tools to be used in the course.
